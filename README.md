# Night of the Living Slimes
## About
A 2D game designed in Godot based off of GDQuests survivor's style [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU) to learn the basics of the engine. In this game, slimes follow the player, chasing them through a forest attaching to their body which causes damage. The player is only armed at the beginning with a pistol to defend themselves. How long will you survive?
